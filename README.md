To determine how you spend your time, TagTime literally randomly samples you.
At random times it pops up and asks what you're doing *right at that moment*.
You answer with tags.

See
[messymatters.com/tagtime](http://messymatters.com/tagtime )
for the whole story.

This is the reference implementation of the universal ping schedule.

It's hosted at https://tagtime.github.io/rimple

This is just for developers implementing the TagTime algorithm to make sure they're on the same schedule.
